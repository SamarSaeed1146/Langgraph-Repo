        "## Context\n",
        "\n",
        "At LangChain, we aim to make it easy to build LLM applications. One type of LLM application you can build is an agent. There’s a lot of excitement around building agents because they can automate a wide range of tasks that were previously impossible.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice though, it is incredibly difficult to build systems that reliably execute on these tasks. As we’ve worked with our users to put agents into production, we’ve learned that more control is often necessary. You might need an agent to always call a specific tool first or use different prompts based on its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "To tackle this problem, we’ve built [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) — a framework for building agent and multi-agent applications. Separate from the LangChain package, LangGraph’s core design philosophy is to help developers add better precision and control into agent workflows, suitable for the complexity of real-world systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Course Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The course is structured as a set of modules, with each module focused on a particular theme related to LangGraph. You will see a folder for each module, which contains a series of notebooks. A video will accompany each notebook to help walk through the concepts, but the notebooks are also stand-alone, meaning that they contain explanations and can be viewed independent of the videos. Each module folder also contains a `studio` folder, which contains a set of graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio), our IDE for building LangGraph applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Before you begin, please follow the instructions in the `README` to create an environment and install dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chat models\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course, we'll be using [Chat Models](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#chat-models), which do a few things take a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs. LangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations. [Here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) is a list of 3rd party chat model integrations within LangChain! By default, the course with use [GEMINI_API_KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key/) because it is both popular and performant. As noted, please ensure that you have an `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's check that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and, if not, you will be asked to enter it."

Official Documentation:** The best place to start is the official LangChain documentation.  It\\'s well-structured and provides comprehensive tutorials and examples.  Look for their \"Getting Started\" guides and work through the examples.\\n\\n**2. Tutorials and Blog Posts:** Many tutorials and blog posts are available online covering various aspects of LangChain. Search for \"LangChain tutorial\" or \"LangChain examples\" on Google, YouTube, and Medium.  Look for tutorials that focus on specific use cases that interest you (e.g., building a chatbot, creating a question-answering system).\\n\\n**3. GitHub Repository:** Explore the LangChain GitHub repository.  You can find the source code, contribute to the project, and see how different components are implemented.  Reading the code can be a great way to deepen your understanding.\\n\\n**4. Example Projects:**  The LangChain documentation and GitHub repository contain many example projects.  Start by running and modifying these examples to understand how different parts of the framework work together.  Try to build something small and simple first, then gradually increase the complexity.\\n\\n**5. Courses and Workshops:** While not as prevalent as for some other technologies, you might find online courses or workshops specifically on LangChain or related topics (like LLM application development) that can provide structured learning.\\n\\n**6. Community:** Engage with the LangChain community.  Ask questions on forums, participate in discussions, and learn from others\\' experiences.  This can be a valuable way to get help and stay updated on the latest developments.\\n\\n\\n**Learning Path Suggestion:**\\n\\n1. **Start with the official documentation\\'s \"Getting Started\" guide.** This will give you a foundational understanding of the core concepts and components.\\n2. **Work through a few simple tutorials.**  Focus on building something small and concrete, like a simple chatbot or a basic question-answering system.\\n3. **Explore the example projects in the GitHub repository.**  Try modifying them to understand how they work and experiment with different features.\\n4. **Gradually tackle more complex projects.**  As you gain experience, try building more sophisticated applications that leverage the full power of LangChain.\\n\\n\\nRemember to have a specific project in mind as you learn.  This will help you stay motivated and focus your learning on the aspects of LangChain that are most relevant to your goals.  Don\\'t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes – that\\'s how you learn best!\\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run-3a83014b-7f7a-4c85-88e4-d8d4888a28ad-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 39, 'output_tokens': 526, 'total_tokens': 565, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
